          <h2>GAME INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Billy Butcher, Marvin "Mothers" Milk, Hughie Campbell, and Frenchie
            (the titular characters) each have their own reasons for wanting to
            take down Supes — it all ends the same. Battle to the top of Vought
            Tower, fighting new enemies on every floor until you reach
            Homelander at the top and put an end to Vought, Compound-V, and The
            Seven once and for all!
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Fight your enemies, using The Boys strategically to deal damage,
            target weaknesses, and keep one another alive. As long as they stay
            alive, each member of The Boys will get to choose an action before
            their opponent responds. Use the three Action Buttons to choose from
            each of the characters' three character-specific actions. Some
            characters' actions heal their allies; in these cases, use the four
            Heal Target Buttons below the Action Buttons to select the character
            you would like to heal, then select your character's heal action via
            its corresponding Action Button. Each character gets a single
            action, and then it becomes the next character's turn. After all
            members of The Boys have acted, their opponent will respond. Try not
            to get melted by eye-beams or something. If you make it through your
            battle, you'll have the opportunity to proceed further up Vought
            Tower. Defeat enough Supes, and maybe you'll even get to face off
            against Homelander himself...

              The Boys are vigilantes. A CIA black-ops team, their job is to
              police, monitor and potentially stop the Seven, a group of vain,
              inglorious superheroes. Founded by Billy Butcher, The Boys are out
              to expose the corruption they believe the Seven represent.

            <h3>William "Billy" Butcher</h3>
            <p>
              A former member of the British SAS, Billy Butcher is an expert
              marksman, extremely skilled in hand-to-hand combat, and an
              all-around B.A.M.F. While he’s blinded by his hatred for
              Homelander, he’s also a natural leader, uniting The Boys in an
              effort to eliminate The Seven.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use Butcher’s cunning, strength, and sadistic nature to take down
              Supes. Butcher packs a powerful, varied arsenal: manage his
              stamina, and he can bring down almost any Supe.

            <p>
              A former battlefield-medic turned family-man, Marvin “Mother’s”
              Milk (or M.M.), has been out of the game for awhile – that is,
              until Billy Butcher reels him back in. Blaming his father’s death
              on Vought, M.M. won’t stop until he gets retribution.
            </p>
            <p>
              A father, juvenile boys counselor, and former USMC medic, M.M. has
              *range*. Use this versatile character to deal out damage, patch up
              his allies, and maybe even save a life while he’s at it…

            <p>
              Hughie was a mild-mannered guy with a boring job and a girlfriend
              he loved. That is, until A-Train dashed *through* his girlfriend,
              upending his life, and setting it on a course with one sole goal:
              get revenge for Robin.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hughie isn’t much of a fighter, but his skill and cunning in
              combat may surprise you… Use his intelligence and healing
              abilities to support your team in battle.

              A drug-dabbling, gunrunning jack-of-all-trades, Frenchie’s
              skillsets are an invaluable resource to Butcher and The Boys. Once
              a killer-for-hire, the faces of those he’s killed still linger
              with him, unshakable like scars.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frenchie is equally skilled with a blade as he is at science. He
              likes improvising his own weapons — you never know what he’ll come
              up with next.

              The Seven is the most popular and powerful American Superhero
              team, owned and managed by Vought International. They consist of
              seven superheroes; while The Seven oftentimes use their powers to
              stop "crimes", their principal pursuit is typically fame and
              glory.

              The Boys stand a chance?

            <p>
              Egomaniacal and overconfident in his abilities, Translucent’s
              corruption is enhanced further by his (seemingly) indestructible
              skin. A master of stealth, he can sneak anywhere and give bad guys
              the surprise of a lifetime. Translucent loves using his
              invisibility to lurk where he shouldn’t.

              Vought’s social media propaganda. Unfortunately, that’s pretty
              much all the company wants from him — he’s The Seven’s token

              A-Train is a speedster who used to be part of the teenage Supe
              team, Teenage Kix. He inadvertently killed the
              love-of-Hughie’s-life with his powers while high on Compound-V.
              He’ll do whatever it takes to remain in The Seven, because he
              knows it’s only a matter of time until a younger, faster
              challenger takes his place — and that’s a problem even the fastest
