# THE BOYS: SUPE-R DESTRUCTION

---

The Boys: Supe-r Destruction is an RPG-style game with classic Final-Fantasy turn-based combat straight out of the '90s —— based on the hit comic book series and television show: The Boys. Follow a team of 8bit-ish rag-tag vigilantes as they combat super-powered individuals who abuse their powers. Battle to the top of Vought Tower and expose the truth about Vought, The Seven, and Compound-V!

### Game summary:

Billy Butcher, Marvin "Mothers" Milk, Hughie Campbell, and Frenchie (the titular characters) each have their own reasons for wanting to take down Supes — it all ends the same. Battle to the top of Vought Tower, fighting new enemies on every floor until you reach Homelander at the top and put an end to Vought, Compound-V, and The Seven once and for all!

You control The Boys — each character has three core actions and unique core stats:

- M.M. : A father, juvenile boys counselor, and former USMC medic, M.M. has _range_. Use this versatile character to deal out damage, patch up your allies, and maybe even save a life while you're at it…
- Butcher : Use Butcher’s cunning, strength, and sadistic nature to take down Supes. Butcher packs a powerful, varied arsenal: manage his stamina, and he can bring down almost any Supe.
- Hughie : Though not much of a fighter, Hughie's skill and cunning in combat may surprise you… Use his intelligence and healing abilities to support your team in battle.
- Frenchie : Equally adept with a blade as he is with a beaker, Frenchie likes playing mad-scientist, often improvising his own weapons — you never know what he’ll come up with next.

Fight your enemies, using The Boys strategically to deal damage, target weaknesses, and keep one another alive. As long as they stay alive, each member of The Boys will get to choose an action before their opponent responds. Use the three action buttons to choose from each of the characters' three character-specific actions. Each character gets a single action, and then it becomes the next character's turn. After all members of The Boys have acted, their opponent will respond. Try not to get melted by eye-beams or something. If you make it through your battle, you'll have the opportunity to proceed further up Vought Tower. Defeat enough Supes, and maybe you'll even get to face off against Homelander himself...
